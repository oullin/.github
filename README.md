### Who am I?

Welcome to my space. I’m Gus, a software engineer and engineering leader with over twenty years of experience in crafting scalable, high-quality software solutions. My [expertise](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gocanto/) encompasses [Go, Node.js, PHP](https://github.com/gocanto), and modern web frameworks, as well as cloud infrastructure and team leadership. I’ve had the privilege to lead diverse teams, always focused on delivering reliable, efficient, and meaningful technology.

But beyond the technical world, I live by the principles of Zen—embracing presence, balance, and mindfulness in both work and life. Like the carefully stacked stones in a Zen garden, I believe success comes from harmony, patience, and clear focus. This balance guides me in approaching complex challenges with calmness and clarity, turning obstacles into opportunities for growth.

This [blog](https://gocanto.dev/) is a reflection of that philosophy—a place where technology meets thoughtful reflection. Here, I share my journey, lessons learned, insights on engineering, leadership, and the pursuit of continuous learning, all grounded in a mindful approach to life and work.

Whether you are a fellow engineer, a leader, or a curious reader, I invite you to join me in exploring how living with Zen can enrich both our professional and personal paths. Thank you for visiting. Feel free to connect and share ideas, projects, or exchange thoughts.
