# Contributing to Oullin

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Oullin organization! In the spirit of **Ollin**—meaning "movement" and transformation—we welcome contributions that help our projects evolve and grow.

## Philosophy

Like the principles of Zen that guide this organization, we value:

- **Mindful contributions**: Take time to understand the codebase before making changes
- **Clear communication**: Write descriptive commit messages and pull request descriptions
- **Balanced approach**: Focus on quality over quantity
- **Continuous improvement**: Every contribution is an opportunity for growth

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- Search existing issues before creating a new one
- Provide clear steps to reproduce bugs
- Include relevant system information and logs
- Be respectful and constructive in your descriptions

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch** for your feature or fix: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. **Make your changes** with clear, atomic commits
4. **Write or update tests** as needed
5. **Ensure all tests pass** before submitting
6. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of your changes

### Commit Message Guidelines

Write clear, concise commit messages:

```

Use conventional commit prefixes:
