### :leaves: Ollin
In Aztec tradition, **Ollin** means “movement” or “motion,” embodying transformation, heart, life, and the calendar’s purified spirit-day. 
But **Ollin** goes deeper—it speaks to the same gentle momentum at the heart of **Zen**, where each breath, each step, is a flowing wave of presence. 

For anyone on the path of self-discovery, **Ollin** becomes a guide: it reminds us to move with intention, stay grounded 
in the here and now, and welcome life’s shifts as chances to grow. 

Just as **Zen** teaches us to let thoughts pass like clouds, **Ollin’s** energy urges us to embrace change—transforming 
every action into a moment of awareness, renewal, and wholehearted living.

With this organisation’s name, whether it’s spelled **oullin** or **ollin**, or another fun variant. I am deliberately 
riffing on the Aztec **Ollin** to weave “movement,” transformation, and mindful flow right into my identity. That little 
twist in spelling isn’t just for show; it’s a daily nudge to stay present, move with purpose, and welcome every change 
as part of my shared journey.
